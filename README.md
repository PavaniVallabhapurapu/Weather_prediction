Weather prediction involves using meteorological data, mathematical models, and computer simulations to forecast atmospheric conditions. It analyzes factors like  lattitude, longitude, temperature to predict weather patterns. While modern technology improves accuracy, uncertainties remain due to the dynamic nature of the atmosphere.
